## Game Features
The game is a 3d platformer where the main character, Shinno, can travel through dimensions turning herself into a white fox in the soul dimension. While on the soul dimension she can see enemies and cast spirit balls on them. Also, she can gather seeds on plants to grow bindweeds on seed plots. After she comes back into the human dimension, the bindweed grows and she can climb them to access other areas. Her human form cannot engage combat, but can take damage from the Monkey Boss.

The Monkey Boss divides himself into 3 clones and throws fruits on the player character to avoid him from climbing the tree. You need to hit all three Monkeys in the soul dimension in order to complete the level. This game also features:
- Enemy Encounter Spawn System
- Enemy Random Walk AI
- Cinematics
